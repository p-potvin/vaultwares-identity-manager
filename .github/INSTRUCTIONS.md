# 🛡️ VaultWares Enterprise-wide Guidelines for Programming Projects

- **What is VaultWares?**
VaultWares builds consumer-facing tools where **individuals' privacy** comes first. We design products so people can use them without being tracked, profiled, or pressured into sharing more than they intended. **Security is a close second**: we use strong engineering to protect privacy and prevent misuse. **Functionality is our third pillar**: the product should stay genuinely useful and approachable for non-technical people.

Privacy and security often get bundled together, but they are not the same thing. **Privacy** is about what we collect, what we keep, and what we share. **Security** is about how we protect what exists. A product can be secure and still be invasive. Bad actors can also weaponize “security” language to scare people into accepting unnecessary surveillance or data collection. Our job is to **strike the balance**: use security in service of privacy, and avoid fear-driven shortcuts that erode it.

These are general guidelines to apply when coding under the VaultWares umbrella. Use common sense to determine what applies to your project. When tradeoffs are unavoidable, default to: **Privacy (Individuals) → Security → Functionality**. After that, optimize for performance and scalability. Always follow best practices for the specific language and framework you are using, but when in doubt, refer to these guidelines.

## 🚀 Core Tech Stack (varies by project, needs, and team preferences)

- **Google Cloud Services Integration:** If possible, use Google Cloud Run, Deploy, Build, SQL Tools, etc.

- **Frontend Frameworks:** Next.js 15+ (App Router), Django, Blazor

- **Languages:** TypeScript (Strict mode), Python, C#

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with both light and dark mode support. Refer to STYLE.md for more details.

- **State Management:** TanStack Query (React Query) for server state; Zustand for local state.

- **Database/Backend:** CloudSQL Tools: PostgreSQL, GCP Secret Manager

- **UI Components:** Radix UI primitives / Shadcn UI / VaultWares' own Glass UI library.

- **Validation:** Zod for schema validation, especially for API responses and form inputs or plain old TypeScript validation.

- **Native Apps Frontend:** WinUI 3 for Windows Apps, PyQt or PySide for Python GUI

- **Native Apps Backend:** C# .Net, Python

## 🛠️ Coding Standards & Patterns

- **When generating code for VaultWares projects, adhere to the following when applicable:**

- **Component Architecture:** Use Functional Components with Arrow Syntax. Favor Server Components for data fetching and Client Components only when interactivity is required.

- **Always separate your declarations with a space:** (e.g., x = 5, not x=5)

- **Add empty lines between logical blocks of code for better readability. For example:** Separate imports, component definitions, hooks, and return statements with empty lines.

- **Use consistent indentation:** (4 spaces) and avoid mixing tabs and spaces.

- **Keep comments inside functions to a minimum:** if you need to define behavior, do it when declaring the function, not inside it. When using an external library method, leave a comment indicating the default values and any important considerations.

- **Follow language conventions for anything else.**

## 📛 Naming Conventions: 

- **Components:** PascalCase (e.g., ProductVault.tsx)

- **Hooks:** camelCase starting with 'use' (e.g., useVaultAuth.ts)

- **Utilities:** kebab-case (e.g., format-currency.ts)

## 🏆 Coding Best Practices

- **Type Safety:** Avoid any at all costs. Use Zod for schema validation (especially for API responses and form inputs).

- **Performance:** Keep the bloating to a minimum and optimize your methods. e.g., Implement React Suspense for loading states and utilize Next.js Image component for all assets.

- **CorrelationId:** Always implement the functionality 'CorrelationId' in logs to allow easy debugging. The CorrelationId should be a 7 alphanumeric characters string that starts with a lowercase 'c' (e.g., c1a2b3c). This allows us to easily trace logs related to a specific request or action across the entire system.

- **Code Review:** Review your code before finalizing to make sure there are no syntax errors, trailing artifacts, debugging statements, unused imports, etc.

- **API Routes:** Use Next.js API routes for serverless functions. Validate all inputs with Zod and handle errors gracefully.

## 🧭 Principles (Privacy → Security → Functionality)

- **Minimalist Footprint:** Zero-dependency policy for non-essential features.

- **Privacy First (Primary):** Collect the minimum data needed, keep it for the shortest time possible, and make sharing optional. Avoid logging personal data. Prefer local-first processing when it makes sense. Be clear with users about what happens to their information.

- **Security (Second):** Follow OWASP principles. Always validate and sanitize user input. If writing SQL or Supabase queries, ensure Row Level Security (RLS) and least-privilege access are considered.

- **Functionality (Third):** Make the safe choice the easy choice. Keep flows simple, labels plain-language, and defaults privacy-preserving. If something would confuse a non-technical user, redesign it.

- **Error Handling:** Use a centralized error-boundary pattern. Don't just console.log(error); provide user-friendly feedback using a Toast component.

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Look for existing code that can be reused. e.g., check @/components/ui before creating new UI elements to avoid duplicating Shadcn components.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
- **Pull the latest version:** `git fetch; git pull`

## Run Development:

- **For Node.js projects:**
Install dependencies with `npm install`.
Create a `.env.local` with your Supabase keys.
Run `npm run build && npm run start`. 

- **For Python projects:**
Create a local `.venv` and install Python dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Create a `your-project.cmd` next to `your-project.py` with the following content:
```cmd
@echo off
python "%~dp0your-project.py" %*
```
Then add the cmd folder to PATH and run:
```powershell
your-project your-command your-argument --your-flags
```
