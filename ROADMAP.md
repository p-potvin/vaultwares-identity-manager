# VaultWares Identity Manager — Roadmap

## Product Definition

A privacy-first identity vault that lets users:

- Store encrypted logins, addresses, cards, TOTP seeds, notes, files, and related metadata
- Generate fully fictional but realistic personas for online sign-ups
- Detect sign-up and login pages in the browser and suggest either a new fictional identity or an existing domain-linked one
- Manage the same encrypted vault across browser, desktop, iOS, and Android clients
  - **Blocked today.** Vault sync is local-only (the extension syncs to a
    `vault-warden` on the same machine), so devices share nothing. Reaching this
    goal means putting users on their own tailnet and pointing their devices at
    one shared `vault-warden` over it, then provisioning the account key to each
    approved device. See `docs/crypto-status.md`.

**Not intended for:** impersonation, KYC bypass, forged identity documents, reference-image cloning, or evasive abuse automation.

## Current State (v2.0)

- Browser extension (Chrome + Firefox MV3) with PQC crypto, vault UI, popup, content script, onboarding
- 14 API endpoints under `/v1/` in `vaultwares-api` (auth, vault CRUD, sync, devices)
- Zero-knowledge encryption: ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA-65, AES-256-GCM, Argon2id KDF
- Encrypted local cache with sync-ready records

## Epics

### EPIC-01: Branding, UI/UX Skeleton, Encryption Flow

**Goal:** Define visual identity, trust language, interaction model, and encryption-facing UX.

**Workstreams:**
1. Theme audit and candidate skins (from `vault-themes`)
2. Brand foundation (name, tone, value prop, trust language, icon direction)
3. UX skeleton (extension popup, full vault, desktop, iOS, Android IA)
4. Encryption and recovery UX (onboarding, PIN, device registration, recovery kit, lost-device)
5. Canva program (moodboard, sitemap, screens, diagrams)

**Done when:** Approved brand foundation, semantic tokens, screen skeletons, encryption/recovery UX diagrams.

### EPIC-02: Web Extension, Database, API

**Goal:** Turn the local-only prototype into the first client of a global encrypted identity platform.

**Workstreams:**
1. Extension architecture rewrite (encrypted storage, sync-ready, module boundaries)
2. Cross-browser support (Chrome/Firefox packaging, QA matrix)
3. API surface spec (`/v1` routes for auth, devices, vault, sync, domains, generation, artifacts)
4. Database schema v1 (users, devices, vault items, item versions, domain profiles, audit events)
5. `vaultwares-api` expansion (persona generation, async jobs, callback signing)
6. Mock commerce and entitlements (plan catalog, invoices, subscriptions — simulated)

**Done when:** Approved extension PRD, API/schema package, api plan, sync/offline strategy.

### EPIC-03: Encryption Implementation and Module Integration

**Goal:** Specify the full cryptographic architecture connecting extension, API, and pipelines.

**Workstreams:**

1. Key hierarchy (account root, device keys, item keys, recovery material, wrapping/rotation)
2. PIN and session unlock (Argon2id derivation, session lifetime, re-lock triggers, biometric)
3. Vault envelope format (version, ciphertext, nonce, wrapped key, metadata, integrity)
4. Recovery and rekey (recovery kit contents, export/import, rekey triggers, lost-device)
5. Pipelines artifact sealing (encrypted generation results, signed callbacks, searchable metadata)
6. Sync and conflict handling (optimistic writes, pending queue, version merge, conflict UX)
7. Security observability (correlation IDs, audit/risk events, logging rules, dashboards)

**Done when:** Server cannot decrypt vault by design, generated bundles arrive encrypted, recovery/revocation flows are concrete.

### EPIC-04: Desktop, Mobile, Mock Data, Tests

**Goal:** Deliver companion clients and release-grade QA.

**Workstreams:**
1. Desktop client (vault browsing, CRUD, artifact review, device approval, recovery, mock plans)
2. iOS client (SwiftUI shell, Password AutoFill extension, Secure Enclave/keychain)
3. Android client (native shell, AutofillService, encrypted cache, unlock)
4. Mock data services (simulated plans, entitlements, phone/IP products)
5. QA matrix (cross-client sync, onboarding/recovery, autofill, accessibility, performance, offline)
6. Finishing touches (empty states, edge copy, store icons, packaging checklists)

**Done when:** Approved PRDs for desktop/iOS/Android, mock service catalog, QA matrix, release checklist.

### EPIC-05: Research, Deferred Commercial, Marketing

**Goal:** Research future commercial/infrastructure layers without implementation.

**Constraint:** Research-only — no implementation until legal entity, budget, and provider strategy are ready.

**Workstreams:**
1. Billing research (self-managed vs provider, legal/compliance, mock-to-real migration)
2. Phone number product research (providers, portability, compliance, fraud)
3. IP/network product research (static vs dynamic, abuse monitoring, provisioning)
4. Pricing and packaging (plan ladder, low-cost vs high-cost features, mock-only gates)
5. Marketing and publicity (positioning, audience segments, messaging, launch narrative)
6. SEO and content (content clusters, keywords, landing pages, education strategy)
7. Website revamp (IA, conversion funnels, feature pages, asset requirements)

**Done when:** All research briefs authored with decision criteria and deferred implementation gates.

## Architecture Decisions

- **ADR-001:** Product boundary — fictional personas for privacy, not impersonation or KYC bypass
- **ADR-002:** Zero-knowledge model — server stores ciphertext only, clients own decryption
- **ADR-003:** Repo boundaries — extension, API, desktop, iOS, Android as separate repos
